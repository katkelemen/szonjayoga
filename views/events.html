          <p>
            Throughout your stay, SzonjaYoga guests will be hosted at the Campo di Luna agriturismo The huge

family house is built in a couple of years ago on a hill side, using natural materials, colours, beautifully

renewed old wooden furniture. You will be surrounded by a huge olive grow, forests, hills and with the

view of the Ligurian sea. Here you will have the opportunity to experience the beauty of nature, the

quietness and tranquility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The house follows the line of simplicity but it is welcoming and cozy. The kitchen is an important part

of the Italian family’s daily life; that is why the kitchen and living room are opened together, creating a

huge space. They have a wall to wall glass door which opens to the terrace and looking at the sea.

The view is just spectacular! Can you imagine sitting in the terrace and watching the amazing sunset

whilst eating the delicious homemade dinner?
          <p>
            The rooms are nice and cool during the hot summer days. They are not over furnished. The owners

used natural materials and colours to make the rooms nice and cozy. There are rooms for 2 or 3

people. The beds are new and comfortable, so you can be assured that you will have a pleasant

night's sleep during your stay. Every room has a bathroom with all the necessary facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The farm intends to be as self-sufficient as it is possible. They have chosen to use renewable

energy resources, what nature can give us. On the roof there are many solar panels that use the sun's

rays to generate electricity or heating. Everyone in the farm drinks fresh water from a

pure mountain spring. For the household water they built in huge tanks under the ground, collecting

water from wood spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also produce many kind of vegetables and fruit, they also have an olive grow with over 400 olive

trees. They are using their own seasonal products for cooking and making their own olive oil. You will

have the chance to taste these delicious products. From the garden to the table!
          </p>
          <p>
            In the garden and on the terrace you will find lots of comfortable chairs, sun loungers where you can

rest, relax and recharge.
